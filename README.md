# Lab 5 - Starter

1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because it is a feature that has multiple components to integrate. Using unit testing would prevent us from seeing how the components of this feature interact, which would make fixing any errors much harder. 
2. I would use a unit test because it would be testing one component with a clear rule that text cannot be longer than 80 characters. Since I would only have to worry about length, it would be useful to use the unit test.
